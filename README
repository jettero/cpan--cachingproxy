AUTHOR'S NOTE 

I was particularly thrilled with Jamis Buck's Dungeon Generator
(http://www.aarg.net/~minam/dungeon.cgi), but I wanted to design something
a little more flexible -- particularly, new export and generation plugins.

SYNOPSIS

    use Games::RolePlay::MapGen;
    use Games::RolePlay::MapGen;

    $map->set_generator("Basic");             # This is actually the default generator,
    $map->add_generator_plugin("BasicDoors"); # however, you must add the doors.
    generate $map("map.txt");                 # It'll generate a text map by default.

    $map->set_exporter( "BasicImage" );       # But a graphical map is probably more useful.
    export $map("map.png");
