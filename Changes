1.4: Tue Mar 24 11:52:10 EDT 2009
   - RSRCHBOY requested that the $pinfo regexp be converted to a
     package option.  That change has been made.

1.3: Mon Aug 18 09:07:51 EDT 2008
   - found a few variable name bugs/typos
   - added a couple more expiration options
   - added an LWP timeout option

1.2: Tue Aug 12 07:19:25 EDT 2008
   - I taught the cache about an alternate expiration for the
     index files.  It makes sense to only cache them for a
     shorter while...

1.1: Thu Aug  7 16:04:01 EDT 2008
   - ditched version.pm
   - re-wrote a couple of examples and docs
     (the key_space stuff)
   - minor path patch

1.0.3: Sat May 31 09:22:38 EDT 2008
   - wow, wasn't using the this->{ua}.  instantiated it, but
     never used it.  brilliant.

1.0.2: Tue May 27 10:17:15 EDT 2008
   - minor doc changes
   - minor updates to the backend URL construction
   - made the DEBUG messages optoinal and not default
   - fixed a very minor bug in the mirror urlification
   - (wow, use version has to be on the same line as our $VERSION
      for older EUMM)

1.0.1: Mon May 26 15:32:02 EDT 2008
   - I might as well do a new version of everything using
     version.pm while I wait for all my CPAN deletes to go
     through.  I just discovered that version.pm doesn't/didn't
     go core until perl 5.9...  I really wish I'd have prereqed
     it everywhere I used it, but I didn't.  *sigh*

1.0.0: Sat May 24 09:31:16 EDT 2008
   - using version.pm as suggested by Andreas Koenig
